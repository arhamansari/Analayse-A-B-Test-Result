# Analayse-A-B-Test-Result
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project: Analyze-AB-Test-Results

Description :
In this project a dataset containing the conversion rates between new and old websites for an e-commerce website is going to be analyzed. This project is meant to give a practical example for how the statistics learned in part 4 of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree course can be used.

The data will be used to perform an A/B test, the goal is to work through the notebook to help the community understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old one or run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Steps :
Answer all of the questions
Make sure to answer what the e-commerce company should do in light of the results
Double the check the code to make it efficient in places where I used inefficient solutions
